# Deployment Through Big Bang

To install Jira as a community package in a Big Bang Kubernetes Cluster, save the following YAML to a file (eg, jira.yaml):

See https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/docs/guides/deployment-scenarios/extra-package-deployment/#Wrapper-Deployment for more details.

```yaml
packages:
  # This will be used as the namespace for the install, as well as the name of the helm release. If this is changed, the destination service (below) needs to also be changed.
  jira:
    dependsOn:
      #- name: authservice
      #  namespace: bigbang
    enabled: true
    # Disabling this will bypass creating the istio VirtualService and NetworkPolicies.
    wrapper:
      enabled: true
    git:
      repo: https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/product/community/jira
      # It is recommended to update this to the latest bb tag
      tag: 1.16.0-bb.1
      path: chart
    # This section is ignored if `wrapper.enabled`, above, is false. In this case, creation of an ingress for web access is left as an exercise for the reader.
    istio:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
        - names:
            # Sub-URL for reaching the web UI; it will be reachable with this, plus your bigbang domain, eg, jira.bigbang.dev.
            - jira
          gateways:
            - public
          destination:
            # The second portion of this URL is the namespace; if it was changed above, it needs to be changed here as well.
            service: jira.jira.svc.cluster.local
            port: 8080
    # Anything in this section is passed to the jira chart directly; this allows all of your bigbang configuration to be in a single place.
    values:
      jira:
        service:
          port: 8080

```

Then install/update bigbang via the standard `helm upgrade` command, adding `-f <YAML file location>` to the end. This will install Jira into the named namespace. 

This method is recommended because it will also take care of creating private registry credentials, the istio virtual service, and network policies. Once the installation is complete, the Jira UI will be reachable via `https://jira.<your bigbang domain>`


# ECK Integration in JIRA

Pre-requisites

Jira is deployed

ECK/Fluentd is deployed

# Getting Started

1. Login to Kibana
    username: elastic
    Password : <password> 
    Password can be obtained by querying kubectl get secret elasticsearch-es-elastic-user -n elastic -o yaml

2. Create Index by  selecting Management icon from the left menu and  clicking Index patterns under Kibana
    In the Create Index patterns <logstash-*> and click create index pattern.
    In the the next step Click on the dropdown and select "@timestamp"

 3. For Search click on Discovery from the side menu
 
 4. In KQL textbox enter the  field of interest for eg:  "kubernets.namespace.name : jira"
 
 5. Click Refresh/Update
 

NOTE: Default indexpattern is "logstash-*" and this may change in future. Check the available index name 

    # Grafana Integration

    In order to integrate Jira log data in a Big Bang cluster, include the package when installing the main helm chart under the [`packages`](https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/docs/guides/deployment-scenarios/extra-package-deployment/) section. This key is intended for use with mission applications or other apps which are not directly included and integrated within Big Bang. The below instructions should work with a basic Big Bang configuration, running only Flux, Istio, and the Big Bang packages referenced below. This can be easily appended to the product generated by the [Quickstart guide](https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/docs/guides/deployment-scenarios/quickstart/)

    ```
packages:
  jira:
    dependsOn:
      - name: monitoring
        namespace: bigbang

      # It is recommended to update this to the latest bb tag
      tag: 1.16.0-bb.3
      path: chart
    # Anything in this section is passed to the jira chart directly; this allows all of your bigbang configuration to be in a single place.
    values:
